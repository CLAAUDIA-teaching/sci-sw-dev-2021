#### Code and documentation submitted by Avishek Das (adas@create.aau.dk)

### Available Resources
* A given python file (print_kpthesaurus.py) to extract IDs of each case.
* A given R file (analyse_and_visualize.r) to produce plot of the ID against cases.
* A set of case files in JSON format

### Requirement
* Need to develop to a **Bash** script to automate the process of gathering data from the files, extracting ID and plot the data using Python and R scripts. In a way the **Bash** script will perform as a glue between two piece of tools and data.
