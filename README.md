Hi,
This sofware can help you to analyse the frequency distribution of certain themes treated by the European Court of Human Rights. Data input must be in .json format and each file in the data/ directory is represented by an id, which is related to a certain legal theme. The software itself is composed by two sub-scripts:
- A python script, which can extract each file's id and produce a data.csv file (through a loop in the software script)
- An R script, which takes the data.csv file and print a plot of the distribution/count of different IDs in a sorted form in .pdf format
May you wish to send inquiries, please write to: lucam@build.aau.dk.
