# This is course project for sci-sw-dev-2021.
# Written by Esther Hahyeon Kim. 
Repository for projects in the PhD course Tools for Scientific Software Development and Data Science

The purpose of this project is for 
1) Practicing methodologies I have learned from course 
2) Practicing reproducible research perspective of approach 
	- therefore understand the basic code provided from lecturer and reproduce new code according to own purpose.   


Description about each codes. 

# print_files.py
step1. Read all the .json files from /data folder. And return the .json file name list. 
step2. Check every .json files according to the list from "step1", and extract only specific row that I pre-setted.
step3. I refer to the given code "print_kpthesaurus.py" for reproducing. 

# newdata_1.csv
step1. Every checking for each .json files, printout the specific id information to the new file (newdata_1.csv). 

# newdata_1.pdf
step1. When newdata_1.csv is ready, use Rscript "analyse_and_visualize.r" for printout plots.
