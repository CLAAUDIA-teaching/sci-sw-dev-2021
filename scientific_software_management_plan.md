# Scientific Software Management Plan

A Scientific Software Management Plan (SSMP) is a tool for researchers to help them plan a research project involving software as a part of research work. See this as a dynamic document you can work on an adapt over time as you work on the software. It is not a design document but more a document to clarify your thought and the consequences of different choices. If it helps you in your work you are free to use it in the future. If its just another layer of administrative work then think about why this is so and possible adapt or fully abandon the concept of a SSMP.

The texts in italic is inserted to provide guidance. Some parts may not be valid for your particular research and should then just be filled with "not relevant".

This plan is inspired by the following [Data Management Plan](https://healthsciences.ku.dk/research/responsible-conduct-of-research/SUND_Data_Management_Plan_Template_Final.docx/SUND_Data_Management_Plan_Template_Final.docx) and [Software Management Plan](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2159713)

# Overview

Project Title: the European Court of Human Rights Analysing Tool

## Main researcher: 
*Zhichen Lai*

## Research leader: 
*Zhichen Lai*

## Collaborators: 
*Thomas Arildsen, Gergely Barsi*

## Project contact: 
*zhla@cs.aau.dk*

## Related document(s):
*the European Court of Human Rights*

# Planning the project

## Purpose
*Looking at the distribution, i.e. how often different keywords are mentioned in each document/case.*

## Where will code exist during project?: 
*The code will exist in Github*

## Software development: 
*The software will be developed by Python, R and shell script, following a formal guideline. There will be peer-review of code, and bugs and issues will be tracked by Github. Since the data source is trustworthy and our code is also solid, the results are trustworthy.*
## Programming languages:
*The software will be developed by Python, R and shell script, since they are easy to learn. I will use Pycharm to develop this tool. These tools are free to use.*

## Methods: 
*We count the distribution of keywords by counting, which in fact does not require us to extend the method* 

## Code Documentation: 
*The documentation is a ReadMe markdown file*

## Testing: 
*The software will be compard with other groups'* 

## Validation: 
*We should find more data for validation*

## Code and data: 
We will follow the standard naming and organizing methods.*

## Version control: 
*Version control will be done by Github, since it is so easy to use*

# Processing data

##  Will you processing include randomness?: 
*The results can be reproduce.*

## Cleaning of data: 
*We dont have to pre-process data.*

## Multiple steps?: 
*There will be a shell script to automate the process*

# Sharing
## Will you share your code? 
*The code will be made avaiable in Github*

## Which publication channel? 
*To be decided*

## Who should have access and who will govern access?
*The main leader of our group will govern access, and everybody inside our group will have access.*

## Documentation 
*Please check the ReadMe.md file*

## Dataset documentation and publication: 
*Since we do not have the copyright of the dataset, we can not do this.*

## Licensing 
* Right to usage in proprietary and commercial software is conserved by our group *
